This function is designed to check for the existence of a file. Answers the
question: "The file does not exist ??".


The function can also answer the questions: "Will the file be closed?"


If you need to know the answer to the question:
  "The file does not exist?" - "False" - No, "True" - Yes.
  "Will the file be closed?" - use the functionality: "try", "except".


The function can understand and return 3 events:
  The file is missing. "True".
  The file exists. "False".
  The file is not closed (exception - "FileDidNotClose").


In addition to 2 events (from "return"), there is 1 more Exception
(FileDidNotClose - from "raise") - says that the file is not being closed.


Arsenal: 2 bool values and 1 exception.


Events:
   File exists: "False".
   File does not exist: "True".
   The file is not closed: "FileDidNotClose".


If you do not need some functionality, you have the right to remove it (if you
understand what you are doing).
